### About Me 

Hello! I am an experienced para-professional Therapist with a year of experience in the field, as well as other volunteering opportunities.

With skills in customer service, problem solving, database administration, and programming, I am able to create and manage databases for small and medium-sized companies. I am adept at Excel, Python, and MS Access. 

My wide-ranging skill set, commitment to fine details, and passion for learning, prove me as a valuable asset.  In my spare time, I like to garden at home and hike on the weekends.

### Projects

#### Microsoft Access Transcripts
 - This Microsoft Access project required me to make two tables of data and connect them using relationships and using these relationships to create reports that produce grade transcripts for students.

 - I needed to make an easy way to manage multiple students using two tables of data and making reports based on this data.
 I used Microsoft Access through Apporto
 I struggled creating the reports as I had forgotten to make the grades a numerical value so it would not display, I then realized this mistake and corrected it.
 I used tutorials provided through Loyola University.
 I was able to achieve an organized data table and two well made student transcripts.

#### JDoodle Personality Test

 - This JDoodle project uses loops to cycle through 10 questions and 30 responses as well as if statements to prevent errors as well as decide three different personality types.
 - 
 - I needed to code a test that is able to use answers to questions to categorize individuals with a personality type.
 I used JDoodle.
 I struggled to get the questions to loop as well as display different answers after each question, however I was able to separate the strings into one question and three answers to make it more organized.
 I was able to make a program that made a well-organized test that accurately describes a personâ€™s personality and allows them to typecast their own answers with an error response if needed.

#### Excel Bi-Weekly Timesheet
 - This Microsoft Excel assignment uses dates, days, and times to make an organized timesheet that allows users to easily enter their hours worked and produce a sum of those hours.
 - [insert project 3 screenshot here]
 - I needed a timesheet that is able to easily plug-in the time that I worked and accurately calculate my total time worked each week.
 I used Microsoft Excel
 I struggled to get the correct data type so that it would add more than 24 hours for the amount of hours worked, however I was able to find a format that did not have a 24 hour max.
 I was able to make a table that allows users to easily enter hours worked and produce a sum of that time for two weeks.
